# Build-speed benchmark

`just bench` measures Rust build time on the pinned projects and build configurations in [corpus.toml](corpus.toml).
It runs nightly in CI ([bench.yml](../../.github/workflows/bench.yml)), and on a PR that changes this harness (apart from the [Nix comparison](#nix-builds)), its workflow, the `build-bench` shell, or the `bench-ra-jit` package.
Every build-speed change here states its effect with its numbers.

```bash
just bench                                    # everything; takes hours
just bench --corpus regex --runs 1            # a quick smoke test
just bench --corpus moq --variant baseline --variant mold
```

The script enters the `build-bench` dev shell itself, which holds only what the benchmark runs: the stable toolchain, a pinned nightly, hyperfine, mold, wild, measureme, and the script's tools.
Results land in `target/bench/results/`, newest at `target/bench/results/latest/report.md`.
Checkouts and builds live in `/var/tmp/rust2-bench-<user>/` with their own `CARGO_HOME`, since cargo reads every `.cargo/config.toml` above the directory it runs in and a user-level one (such as `build.incremental = false`) would change what is measured.
The run also ignores the caller's `CARGO*`, `RUSTC*`, `RUSTDOC*`, `RUSTUP*`, and `RUSTFLAGS` variables, and `CI` and `TF_BUILD`, which make newer cargo skip incremental compilation.

## Corpus

- **moq** builds `moq-relay`, which pulls in moq-net, the QUIC stack, and C code through aws-lc-sys.
- **moq-pure-crypto** builds the same `moq-relay` with its crypto on graviola and RustCrypto, so it compiles no C: the run fails if any crate in its build gains a `links` key or pulls in cc or cmake, while pure-Rust build scripts stay allowed.
- **regex** and **wasmparser** are pure Rust: the run fails if any crate in their build gains a build script or a `links` key.

Each corpus pins a git revision (and a lockfile when the project commits none).
Bump a pin in its own change, since numbers on either side of it do not compare.

## Scenarios

- `check`: a clean `cargo check`.
- `build`: a clean debug `cargo build`, dependencies included.
- `edit-leaf`: rebuild after a body edit in a crate nothing else in the build depends on.
- `edit-hub`: the same edit in a crate most of the build depends on (moq-net in moq).
- `edit-sync`: rebuild after an edit to the body of a sync function the build calls, in a module of the hub (moq: `goaway::Producer::send`, which moq-relay calls to drain a session).
- `edit-async`: the same in an `async fn` (moq: `Session::closed`, which moq-relay awaits).
- `test-build`: a clean build of the corpus's tests with `cargo nextest run --no-run`, as CI builds them with a cold cache.
- `test-run`: run those tests, already built.
- `test-edit`: rebuild the tests after the hub edit, as CI does when its compilation cache serves every dependency.

The leaf and hub edits rewrite a marker function appended to the crate root, which nothing calls; the body edits rewrite a statement at the top of the body.
Either way every run changes code that reaches codegen and moves no other line.
The body edits run only on a corpus that names them and only for the variants that list them: cargo rebuilds the same crates for them as for `edit-hub`, so they set apart only the levers that skip work inside an edit, such as ra-jit and relinking without rebuilding.
The test scenarios run only on a corpus that names its tests (moq: every workspace crate `moq-relay` builds) and only for the variants that list them, since a test build costs more than `build`.
They build without incremental compilation, as CI does.
A test run runs every test even when some fail, and the report lists how many failed, since a failed test can end sooner than a passing one.
Before the timed runs, each variant does one untimed clean build that warms the disk cache and logs any failure.
Each timed run starts after a `sync`: on CI's 16 GiB runners, writing back the dirty pages that earlier runs left made the edits it overlapped about 10% slower.

## Variants

A variant is a toolchain plus rustflags.
Each is compared against its `base`, run in the same job: the levers on stable against `baseline`, the nightly ones against `nightly`.
The `control` variants repeat their base, so their change is the run's noise floor: an A/A control.
Timed runs interleave the variants and rotate which goes first each round, so drift over a long job spreads across all of them.
To measure a new build-speed change, add a variant whose base is the configuration it improves on.

The `ra-jit` variant builds with `cargo ra-jit` ([ra-jit](https://github.com/indexable-inc/ra-jit), pinned in `flake.nix` and compiled from source on a run that selects it), a daemon that compiles only the functions an edit changed and splices them into the program cargo linked, or hands the build back to cargo.
ra-jit works with one rustc only, so its base, `ra-jit-baseline`, is plain cargo on that toolchain.
Both run on the moq corpora only, since ra-jit needs a program to load, and skip `check`, which `cargo ra-jit` fails on moq.
The daemon keeps working after a build returns, so each ra-jit run waits for it to go idle before and after, and none of its work overlaps another run.
Its CPU time adds the daemon's, its peak RSS adds what the daemon holds, and its instructions read `n/a`; the report also says how many of its runs the daemon built, and why cargo built the rest.
The leaf and hub markers are functions nothing calls: rustc recompiles their crate and every crate that depends on it, while ra-jit, when it builds the edit itself, compiles nothing, so its times there are a lower bound.
The body edits are functions the program runs, which ra-jit compiles.

ra-jit bugs seen on moq at the pinned rev, not reported upstream:

- `cargo ra-jit check` with no build loaded reads every crate of the workspace, takes minutes and GBs, and fails on errors rustc does not report (`unresolved macro moq_clock::test` in moq-net's integration tests).
- Async body edits in moq-net go to cargo (every `edit-async` run): "`new` is not compiled by ra-jit and rustc's copy is from before the edit: an instance of it does not compile". The daemon then loads the workspace again: on CI such an edit took 55.7 s and 222 CPU-s, against plain cargo's 9.1 s and 12.3 CPU-s ([run](https://github.com/kixelated/rust2/actions/runs/40285528419)).
- A fallback logs `Duplicate definition of identifier ... <cc::Build>::cargo_metadata` while compiling aws-lc-sys's build script.
- On a library-only build such as regex, `cargo ra-jit build` returns after `cargo clean` without building anything.

The report shows wall time (trimmed mean, and mean ± standard deviation), CPU time and its change against the base, retired instructions, and peak RSS, all from hyperfine.
A busy host adds an occasional slow run, which on an edit of a few seconds can move a mean by over 10%, so the change against a base compares trimmed means, which drop each variant's fastest and slowest run; CPU time and instructions are trimmed means too.
Instructions barely move with machine load, so they are the signal on a busy machine, where wall time is only a smoke test; they read `n/a` where the host exposes no performance counters.
No threshold is set: the numbers inform a decision, they do not gate one.

## Nix builds

`just bench-nix` measures moq's Nix release builds (`moq-relay`, then `moq-cli`) in CPU time, built each way they could share compilations:

- `crane`: moq's flake as it is, a dependency layer and a workspace layer per package.
- `crane-mbx`: the same packages with no dependency layer, every compilation going through mbx on a store mounted into the sandbox with `extra-sandbox-paths`, as nixpkgs' ccache support does.
- `crate2nix`: a derivation per crate, from `crate2nix generate`, so the Nix store itself is the cache.
- `cargo-mbx`: cargo through mbx outside Nix, as moq's CI builds today, with a fresh target directory per build.

```bash
just bench-nix                                 # every variant; takes hours
just bench-nix --variant crane --variant crate2nix
```

[nix.toml](nix.toml) pins moq, the packages, the edit, and the lockfile bump; [nix.nix](nix.nix) holds the builds, with the toolchain, features, and `RUSTFLAGS` of moq's overlay throughout.
Results land in `target/bench/nix/`, newest at `target/bench/nix/latest/report.md`.
It runs nightly in CI, never on a pull request: it informs a choice rather than gating a change.

Each variant runs four scenarios in order on a private Nix store and mbx store, so only the first is cold:

- `clean`: the first package from nothing.
- `second-package`: the second package, which shows what the two share.
- `edit-hub`: the first package after the moq-net body edit the cargo scenarios make.
- `lock-bump`: the first package after `cargo update` of one dependency, the edit reverted.

A cold edit or bump costs what `clean` does, so only the warm ones run.
Each Nix build runs in a store of its own, which substitutes only from cache.nixos.org, so nothing the host or moq's cache built leaks in; before the timed build, it realises everything the build needs that does not compile Rust (toolchain, sources, vendored crates).
That store runs its builds as this user in user namespaces, which makes their CPU time the `nix` process's own; Ubuntu reserves those namespaces for root unless `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` is 0.
Evaluation is timed apart from the build, since crate2nix evaluates a derivation per crate.
The report compares retired instructions, which barely move with machine load, and shows CPU time beside them.
crate2nix takes cargo's release codegen units rather than its default of one, so the variants differ in caching and not in codegen; `crate2nix generate`, which a project commits, is timed but not counted.

### Nix builds for moq

Measured on 2026-10-25 on a busy 32-CPU host, in billions of instructions, at the pin in nix.toml:

| scenario | crane | crane-mbx | crate2nix | cargo-mbx |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `clean` | 3681 | 3377 | 4736 | 3378 |
| `second-package` | 5926 | 3945 | 5951 | 3924 |
| `edit-hub` | 1365 | 1351 | 1008 | 1276 |
| `lock-bump` | 3681 | 1123 | 672 | 1113 |
| total | 14756 | 9894 | 12461 | 9692 |

- A lockfile bump costs crane a full dependency rebuild; the per-crate caches rebuild hyper and the 12 crates above it, a fifth of crane's cost or less.
- moq-cli shares 285 of its 548 compilations with moq-relay; the rest are crates or feature sets moq-relay does not build. crane shares none, and its dependency layer runs a `cargo check` of every dependency before building them.
- mbx restoring 434 compilations costs about as much as crate2nix rebuilding the edit outright.
- crate2nix's clean build costs 29% more, since it compiles build scripts and proc macros at opt-level 3 where cargo uses 0. With its own default of one codegen unit it fell to crane's cost (3695), and its edit and bump to 753 and 496: a lever for cargo too.

## Cranelift for moq's CI

Recommended on 2026-10-25: moq's CI keeps building its tests with LLVM, since 42 of its 5418 tests fail under Cranelift.

- 23 catch a panic, which the Cranelift backend that ships with nightly cannot unwind: it builds every panic as an abort (unwinding is a flag on cg_clif's own build, off by default: [rustc_codegen_cranelift#1567](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_cranelift/issues/1567)).
- 19 abort on an x86 SIMD intrinsic it does not implement, `llvm.x86.sse2.pmulhu.w` ([rustc_codegen_cranelift#171](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_cranelift/issues/171)). moq's CI runs on aarch64, whose intrinsics this x86 benchmark does not try.

The `cranelift` variant's `build` numbers are for that abort build too.

Even passing, it would save little where CI spends its time.
CPU seconds from the [PR run](https://github.com/kixelated/rust2/actions/runs/40235946635) (4 CPUs; an A/A control on that run stayed within 3%):

| CI build | nightly | cranelift | change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cold cache: `test-build` + `test-run` | 475 + 170 = 645 | 366 + 203 = 569 | -12% |
| warm cache: `test-edit` + `test-run` | 219 + 170 = 389 | 169 + 203 = 372 | -4% |

Cranelift builds the tests 23% cheaper but runs them 19% dearer, and the 42 failing tests abort early, so its run cost is a floor.
Wall time falls 8% either way.
moq's CI is usually warm: its compilation cache serves every dependency, and switching backends would miss that cache once.

## Attribution

After the timed variants, one nightly build per corpus (clean, then each edit) records cargo's build analysis log with section timings and rustc's self-profile.
The report splits the unit-seconds of each step by kind of unit (build script compile and run, proc macro, dependency, workspace lib, binary) and by compiler section (frontend, codegen, link), and adds macro and proc-macro expansion time and the costliest queries.
Each edit step also lists its rebuilt units: whether a source file changed or only a dependency, the wall seconds each held the critical path, and rustc's self-time by stage.
Self-profiling slows the build a little, so read this section for shares, not absolute times.

The stages map onto upstream's levers:

- **expand & resolve**: parsing, macro expansion, name resolution, and HIR lowering, which rerun in full for every rebuilt crate.
- **analysis**: every other query, chiefly type and borrow checking and MIR; the parallel frontend spreads it across threads.
- **metadata** and **incremental**: writing the crate's metadata, and loading and saving the incremental cache.
- **mono** and **backend**: monomorphization and partitioning into codegen units, then building and running LLVM; a faster backend (Cranelift, TPDE) shrinks only the backend.
- **link**: the rlib archive or the final link, where mold and wild apply.

Units rebuilt only for a dependency are what relinking without rebuilding would skip, so their critical-path seconds, less the final link, bound that saving.
