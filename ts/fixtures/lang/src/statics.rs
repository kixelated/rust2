//! `static` atomics, each one value every use shares: of every kind, at module level and
//! in a function, as kio's `waiter` keeps its ids, starting from a value of the type's
//! extremes. Statics of any type, read from the memory rustc evaluated: a struct holding
//! an atomic, an `AtomicPtr` as parking_lot keeps its table in, std's `OnceLock`,
//! `LazyLock`, and `Once`, one in a struct as crossbeam-epoch keeps its collector, and one
//! pointing at a static of a module that reads it back; and `const`s holding cells, each
//! use of which is a value of its own, as lock_api's `RawMutex::INIT` is. Each case leaves
//! every static as it found it, or reads only what it holds whatever ran before, so a fresh
//! instance and a reused one agree.
