# Migrating

## Unreleased

- In `exclude` and `rename`, a path that a field shares with a method or constant of its
  type, such as `Backoff::initial`, names only the method, as in rustdoc. Name the field
  `field@Backoff::initial`: an `exclude` that left out both now needs both entries.
- Every export defines `<prefix>_contract` and `<PREFIX>_CONTRACT`, so an exported item
  that the naming rule names either, such as a crate root's `pub fn contract` or
  `pub const CONTRACT`, clashes with them: give it another name with a `rename`.
