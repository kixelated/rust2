//! The front end rust2's rustc drivers share.
//!
//! A driver binary is two programs. Run directly, it is a CLI that runs cargo on a
//! package with itself as `RUSTC_WRAPPER` ([`cargo`]). Run by cargo as that wrapper, it
//! is rustc ([`rustc`]), which compiles every crate as rustc would and hands the
//! configured library to the driver's callbacks.
